      Hi, I'm Hoyeon Ma, and I usually go by Edward. I was born in South Korea, <br>
      and came to Canada to study English, and stayed to receive further education <br>
      about Biomedical Science.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      While I was studying Biomedical Science, I was fascinated by how data was taking <br>
      a vital role in assignments and ongoing researches. So I decided to invest on <br>
      studying about data.
